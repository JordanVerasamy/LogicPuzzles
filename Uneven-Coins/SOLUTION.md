####1. weigh A and B vs B' and C'

If A and B were heavier, then there are three possibilities:

i) A and B both heavy; B' and C' both light

ii) A and B both heavy; B' light and C' heavy

iii) A light and B heavy; B' and C' both light

We need some test to differentiate between these three possibilities in this case.

####2a. If A and B were heavier:

If it was equal, there are two possibilities:

i) A heavy and B light; B' heavy and C' light

ii) A light and B heavy; B' light and C' heavy

We need some test to differentiate between these two possibilities in this case.

####2b. If the first weighing was equal: weigh C vs C'

If B' and C' were heavier, then there are three possibilities (note that these are the mirror image of the first case above)

i) A and B both light; B' and C' both heavy

ii) A heavy and B light; B' and C' both heavy

iii) A and B both light; B' heavy, C' light

We need some test to differentiate between these three possibilities in this case.

####2c. If B' and C' were heavier:
