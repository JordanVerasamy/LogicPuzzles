You are walking down a path when you come to a three-way fork in the road, and you know that one of the paths leads to where you want to go, but the other two lead to certain death. There is a monk sitting at the fork in the road with a sign that reads, "You may ask me exactly one question. If I can answer yes or no truthfully, I will do so. If I cannot, my head will explode." What question do you ask the monk to deduce which path you should take?
